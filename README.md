# nexter-course-files
This is the file for Nexter, a project that was done to learn CSS Grid
This is a html website using SASS to build the CSS style sheet. The SASS files include partials to make the coding of the website modular in design. The partial files feature varibles, mixins, and nesting.
I used the CodeKit app to compile the SASS, so I did not use any other compiler or pre-posessor.
The files in this project are a good reference for anyone that wants to use SASS or CSS Grid.
This site is fully mobile responsive and 95% of this was done using CSS Grid. 
This is a great reference for anyone that wants to build a fully mobile responsive HTML static website.

Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming conventions were used in this project and are easily visible if you take a look at the html.index file. Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development.
